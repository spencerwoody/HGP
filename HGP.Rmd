## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. Here's some math: $$ \sum_{i=1}^N X_i $$ And now some inline math: $\epsilon_i  \sim_{\text{iid}} \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.
 
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

$$ 	\begin{aligned} h_i(t) &\sim \text{GP}(\mathbf{0}, k_h(t, t')) \\
	g_n(t) &\sim \text{GP}(h_i(t), k_g(t, t')) \text{ for } n\in c_i \\
	f_{nr}(t) &\sim \text{GP}(g_n(t), k_f(t, t')) \end{aligned} $$


```{r cars}
summary(diamonds)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
    geom_point(aes(col = cut)) + 
    facet_wrap(~clarity) + 
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

```{r, echo = F, eval = F}
# Run this at the end to make a copy of the html output as index.html
system("cp HGP.html index.html")
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
